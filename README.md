# Python-Portscanner
A portscanner built with python, its my first project and was used on a course video I watched, feel free to edit whatever just credit me if you reupload.

# I will update it...
When I feel like it, it's kind of a whatever type thing to me

## What can it do?
It can scan any IP address to find open ports, it will then return which ports are open and show you on your terminal window.

## Can I use this on windows?
Hell, I don't know, I built this in my Kali VM so if someone wants to port it to windows go for it.
